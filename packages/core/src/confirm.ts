/**
 * The confirm gate for imperative tools, the counterpart of a declarative form
 * without `toolautosubmit`: a destructive tool's execute waits until the
 * person clicks the tool's element on the page.
 *
 * Only a trusted click counts (keyboard activation of a button is a trusted
 * click too): a script calling `el.click()` must never be able to confirm on
 * the user's behalf. Nothing to click on means no confirmation: the call
 * fails rather than run unconfirmed. The click is swallowed, so the element's own handler
 * doesn't run the action a second time: the tool's execute is the single
 * source of the action. So is the scripted click a press library re-fires
 * when it saw no click arrive (see `REFIRE_MS`).
